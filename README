Training.py and testing.py is abandoned from now. keep it there just for reference.

1.	Get the data. Working on handling these data.
1.	import all data.
2.	format all data.
3.	Optimize it to around 50 seconds/(1000 user)/1 thread or 
	100 seconds /(1000 * 8 user)/8 thread for i7-4700MQ(Haswell 4C8T @ 2.4Ghz ~ 3.4Ghz)
	to import 6 month data and initialize everything.
4.	Optimize to 2.5 seconds to do 1 iteration based on data above.
5.	Working on the iteration.
6.	Dispatch data for each month in order to train it with Jan 1 ~ May 30, test with June.
7.	Design model saving plan.
	(not save for now)
8.	Design model iteration plan.
	(test 1 large scale simulating iteration first)
9.	Design model testing plan.
	(train it with Jan 1 ~ May 30, test with June)
