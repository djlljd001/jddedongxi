Training.py and testing.py is abandoned from now. keep it there just for reference.

1.	finished all necessary test.	Screwed up. 
	I think the problem should be the initial query I choose to setup. I still use the old query as reference to train the data,
	and even the original effect is not as same as what it should be. So I need to restart again...
2.	Need to reconsider the model problem.
	1.	tuning the reward function.
	2.	using daily data to train and test, so it might be better for query init.
	3.	distinct the init query. recalculate the iteration. everytime, use Q as add-on model to rerank and give feedback.
